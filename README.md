The Saratoga Chatbot can be used to answer all the questions you have about the city of Saratoga, CA. When you run the program, you will be taken to a domain where you will see the chatbot and be able to ask your questions.

First, the project will run the file *create_index.py*, which crawls all of the imported websites and splits them based on the information each sentence gives. This ensures that the chatbot gives the most accurate and concise information to the user. *create_index.py* is run only once to acquire the necessary information quickly and to keep the chatbot from lagging. Next, the file *streamlit_app.py* will be run, creates the domain for the chatbot. This is the file that makes the chatbot appear for the user. At this point, the chatbot is completely fuctional.

The chatbot can be equally useful to current Saratoga residents, as they can find new restaurants or events to visit.
